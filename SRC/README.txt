- IMPORTANT NOTES:
- If you want to execute the visual studio solution or the executable, you need to unzip the data folder and copy the contents of it inside the data folder
of SRC or BIN folders.

	LShift: move faster with WASD
	WS: move the camera forward/backward along its forward vector.
	AD: move the camera left/right along its side vector.
	QE: move the camera up/down along the global up vector (0,1,0).
	Click + Drag: the mouse should tilt the camera around its yaw and pitch.
	Up/Down: rotate the camera around the pitch.
	Left/right: rotate the camera around the yaw.
	T: change to different texture modes of the gBuffer or the final image
	Ctrl+R: Reload scene
